# Machine Learning and Statistics (2023/24) Coursework

This repository contains the coursework assignments for the Machine Learning and Statistics course offered in the 2023/24 academic year. The coursework consists of two Jupyter notebooks:

### **tasks.ipynb**

This notebook contains the assessment tasks that must be completed for successful course completion. The tasks cover various aspects of machine learning and statistics, including:

* Data manipulation
* Statistical analysis
* Model building

### **project.ipynb**

This notebook is dedicated to the coursework project, which focuses on supervised learning and classification algorithms. The project explores the application of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) method to the Iris dataset, aiming to classify Iris flower species based on four physical features:

1. Sepal length (cm)
2. Sepal width (cm)
3. Petal length (cm)
4. Petal width (cm)
